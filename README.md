# FrogsGame

A simple game for one player. The main goal is to make all the frogs disappear from the screen before the timer goes off.
Whenever the player removes all the frogs from the screen another level is started automatically.
The amount of time given is increased by one second at each level.

## Getting started

Clone or download the directory and open the html file in your browser.
The game will appear immediately and you can start playing by hitting the start button. 
All you have to do now is to remove all the frogs by clicking them, before the timer goes of.
ENJOY :)
